PeerGuardian 2 Credits
----------------------
PeerBlock is based upon the earlier PeerGuardian 2 work.  Many thanks to Cory
Nelson and his Phoenix Labs crew (http://www.phoenixlabs.org) for creating
PG2, and for making it open-source so that after they abandoned it we could
pick it up and resurrect it!
